# FiPy Nucleation Benchmark Example

This directory contains the input files to solve [PFHub benchmark
8a](https://pages.nist.gov/pfhub/benchmarks/benchmark8.ipynb/), which
is a phase field nucleation problem, using the [FiPy] PDE solver.

This is justa a sample example from the FiPy implementation used in
the [nucleation paper]. See [this repository] for a more complete set
of input files.

The FiPy setup is currently far from complete. See the [issues] that
are still broken for more details of problems that still need to be
addressed.

## Installation using Docker

[Install Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/) on your platform
and check that `docker run hello-world` runs. To download and run the
FiPy nucleation benchmark container use,

    $ docker run -it wd15/fipy-nucleation:latest

This will drop you into a bash shell with the necessary dependencies
to run FiPy. See the [Usage section](#usage) for more details.

Note that there is no need to clone this repository to use the Docker
installation.

## Installation using Conda

[Install Conda][conda-install], clone this repository and from the
`fipy` directory,

    $ conda env create -f environment.yml
    $ conda activate fipy-nucleation

This will drop you into an environment with the necessary dependencies
to run FiPy. See the [Usage section](#usage) for more details.

## Installation using Nix

Install Nix, clone this repository and from the `fipy` directory,

    $ nix-shell

This will drop you into an environment with the necessary dependencies
to run FiPy. See the [Usage section](#usage) for more details.

## <a name="usage"> Usage </a>

Currently, the only FiPy implementation is for benchmark 8a. Assuming
that you have followed the installation instructions above then run

    $ python benchmark8a.py params8a.yaml

from the `fipy` directory. The output data will be written to the
`data` directory.

## Build the Docker Instance

To build the Docker instance use,

    $ docker load < $(nix-build docker.nix)

or

    $ docker load < $(nix-build docker.nix) && docker run -it wd15/fipy-nucleation:latest

to build and run.
