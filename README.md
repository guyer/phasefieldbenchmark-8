# Phase Field Benchmark Problems for Nucleation

*Add DOI Link*

This repository contains supplemnatary material and code necessary to
run some of the examples from the paper entitled *Phase Field
Benchmark Problems for Nucleation* authored by *W. Wu et al*
[paper][paper].

## Overview

The paper has results from four different codes, which include [MOOSE][MOOSE],
[FiPy][], [PRISMS-PF] and a custom finite difference code. MOOSE was used
for the results in the paper, but compared with the other codes during
the development of the nucleation benchmark as discussed in the paper.

The containers and
installation instructions are each in four different directories,
[./fipy], [./moose], [./prisms-pf] and [./custom].

Note that this is an ongoing process and has not currently been
completed.
